    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 900;font-style: normal;">LOS ANGELES -- </span> – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warned the nation last week that “the Democratic Party has become the biggest threat to democracy in this country.”  Mr. Kennedy is the son of Senator and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy –two of the former Democratic Party’s most celebrated leaders.  Purged by <span>Neo</span>-Democrats from the party that his father lost his life building, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now an independent candidate for president.  But there is wide speculation that he will soon suspend his independent campaign and align with the forces of Elon Musk and President Trump in a more united effort to stop the rise of the <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span> in America.     </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img class='pic' style="width: 90%;" src="./assets/images/pic2_0822.jpg" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elon Musk interjected Kennedy live into the Trump-Biden debate on the X Platform after CNN blocked Kennedy’s participation in the actual June 27, 2024 Atlanta debate.  Musk’s move is evidence that he shares President John F. Kennedy’s legendary personal commitment to political debate as the cornerstone of American democracy and that he intends to utilize the X Platform to fight censorship during the 2024 presidential campaign.  The attempted assassination of President Trump on July 13, 2024 triggered Musk’s endorsement of Trump for president.  But Musk (historically a liberal who voted Democrat) also shares Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s concerns with the rise of authoritarianism and the Neo-Democratic Party in America –and he enjoys good relationships with President Trump and Mr. Kennedy.  Musk announced on May 18, 2022 that he could “no longer support the Democratic Party.” He wrote that "in the past I voted Democrat because they were mostly the kindness party.  But they have become the party of division and hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.”  Kennedy for his part has announced that he will address the nation’s “present historical moment” on Friday, August 23.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr. Kennedy’s statement last week already articulated one volcanic moment in the history of American politics, which powerfully underscores Musk’s understanding of the transformation of the Democratic Party.  Despite Mr. Kennedy’s lifetime devotion to the Democratic Party, he warned the nation on August 15 that Neo-Democratic Party officials no longer embrace his father’s or President Kennedy’s values.  Kennedy’s entire August 15 statement is <a href="https://x.com/robertkennedyjr/status/1824053188799889650?s=51" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy also warned in a <span>separate</span> statement on August 15 that <span>Neo</span>-Democrat elites “don’t believe in democracy or trust the voters anymore.  They think that <span>they</span> are entitled to choose who you are allowed to vote for.  They think that <span>they</span> should be the judges of what is best for you and your family.”  Kennedy issued these additional warnings after the Democratic National Committee (the DNC) filed a series of frivolous lawsuits in an aggressive attempt to remove him from November 2024 ballots in many states (New Jersey, North Carolina, Maine, Hawaii, Idaho, Utah, and New York).  In essence, the DNC transmuted <span>advocacy</span> for its presidential candidate in these states into attempts to simply <span>remove an opponent entirely from voter ballots</span> –a strategy employed historically only by single-party totalitarian regimes.  Mr. Kennedy declared “that says something about the DNC’s contempt for democracy.”  Kennedy is likely to stress this development in his Friday address.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy handily defeated each of the DNC’s efforts to remove him from state ballots, except New York.  A lower court New York judge ignored the customary indices of domicile (e.g. voter registration, driver’s license, car licenses, and individual intent recognized and accepted by all other states that Kennedy petitioned for ballot access) and imposed what therefore appear to be personal and partisan requirements (e.g. size of residence, its cost, and frequency of physical presence in the domicile).  The judge ruled that Kennedy misstated his domicile according to these novel requirements and invalidated thousands of New York voter signatures, which qualified Kennedy for the New York ballot in November.  In short, the judge summarily disenfranchised every Kennedy Democrat in New York, citing entirely personal requirements.  Kennedy has appealed the decision.  Election law expert, Joe Burns, wrote concerning the New York lower court decision “one doesn’t need to be enamored with RFK Jr.’s views to think that he deserves to appear on the New York ballot.  The law, in fact, is on Kennedy’s side, and the Appellate Division should reverse the trial court decision and restore him to the New York ballot.”  Burn’s detailed analysis of the case is located <a href=https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/legal/opinion/ny-court-errs-in-removing-rfk-jr-from-ballot-a-legal-analysis" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Kennedy announced that he would seek the presidency as an independent candidate, Fox Journalist, Sean Hannity, wanted to know how it was possible that the DNC could be so hostile to the son of one of its most celebrated leaders.  On all accounts RFK Jr.’s presidential campaign is certainly well-within the value tradition of the classical Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Edward M. Kennedy, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cesar Chavez defined Democratic Party. </p>
    <br><br>
   
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic3_0822.jpg" style="width: 90%;"/>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">And to be sure, Mr. Hannity’s query implicitly revealed <span>his</span> understanding, too, that a history of the
      Kennedy family is nearly tantamount to a history of the Democratic Party at least after WWII.
      Hannity accordingly was bewildered that the contemporary DNC, instead of embracing a fair contest
      between Kennedy and Biden (letting voters decide between them) would instead purge Kennedy from
      his father’s party and the party of one of its most formidable presidents, John F. Kennedy --RFK Jr.’s
      beloved uncle. </p>
    <br>
    
    <br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic4_0822.jpg" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy finally gave his most explicit answer to Hannity’s question just last week in his August 15th warnings to the nation. He declared that the <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span> is simply no longer the same party that his father and President Kennedy helped to build.  Kennedy insisted that the “‘V.P. Harris Democratic Party’ would be <span>unrecognizable</span> to my father and uncle.” And he emphasized further that “the Democratic Party of RFK and JFK was the party of civil liberties and free speech.” But the <span>Neo</span>-Democratic Party (which he described as Harris’s party) “is the party of censorship, lockdowns, and medical coercion.  “<span>Kennedy Democrats</span> were anti-war,” but the <span>Neo</span>-Democrats, he added, are “riddled with ‘neocon’ (neo-conservative) warmongers.”   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Kennedy resisted intense pressure in 1961 from the CIA and the Defense Department to invade Cuba, commit large scale combat troops to Vietnam, and strike a belligerent stance with the Soviet Union.  And Kennedy’s father was a powerful force in opposition to the Vietnam War in 1968.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert F.  Kennedy Jr., faithful to the Kennedy tradition, currently opposes the war in Ukraine.  And he has accused the Biden-Harris administration of blocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s efforts to achieve a peace agreement with Russian president Vladimir Putin known as the Minsk Accords resulting in the unnecessary deaths of thousands of young men and risk of world war.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neo-Democratic Party officials have now unilaterally appointed Harris to replace Joseph Biden on the November ballot.  Harris did not participate in the 2024 presidential primaries.  Kennedy responded to the appointment by drawing another contrast between classical Kennedy Democrats and the Neo-Democratic Party.  He declared that his father’s and uncle’s party was “the champion of voting rights and fair elections.” But Harris’s party is the party of “disenfranchisement and coronation of its candidates by corporate donors and party elites.” </p>
