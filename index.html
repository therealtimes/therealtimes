    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 900;font-style: normal;">WASHINGTON, D.C.</span> – President Joseph Biden finally succumbed to intense pressure from within the Democratic Party today and withdrew from the 2024 presidential race.  The pressure to withdraw from the race stemmed from Biden’s demonstrative cognitive decline, but Democratic officials stopped short of asking him to resign from office.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biden’s move casts a sudden spotlight on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy for the presidency.  The Democratic National Convention is still a long-month away.  And at least until the convention closes on August 22 in Chicago the race for the presidency is now a close two-man contest between former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and Mr. Kennedy –an independent candidate for the presidency.  Mr. Kennedy is the son of Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, and Mr. Kennedy’s father was assassinated on June 5, 1968 in Los Angeles while he was celebrating a victory in the 1968 California Democratic Presidential Primary four months before the Democratic National Convention that year.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic1_0721.jpg" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year the Kennedy campaign released a comprehensive opinion poll (“the Zogby poll”) that predicted that President Trump would have beaten Biden by a comfortable margin had Biden remained in the race.  The same poll further predicted that a two-man race between Kennedy and Trump would be very close –Kennedy winning by a slender margin.  The poll now shows Kennedy leading President Trump by 14% in a two-man contest.  While it is too early to fully evaluate the appeal of any candidate who might replace Biden on the Democratic ticket, it nevertheless seems unlikely at this late stage in the 2024 presidential campaign season that any Democrat will poll better against President Trump than President Biden –especially in the critical battleground states.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, unless there are sudden and dramatic changes in the 2024 political landscape, the Zogby poll suggests that Democrats are simply poised to nominate a candidate in Chicago next month who can have only the impact of a spoiler for Kennedy in a close race against President Trump.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, prior to announcing his independent candidacy, Mr. Kennedy was challenging Joseph Biden for the Democratic Party nomination for president against intense opposition from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The DNC’s opposition to RFK Jr. during the primaries was reminiscent of the “behind closed doors” opposition that even his father, Senator Kennedy, faced in 1968 when he opposed Vice-President Hubert Humphrey who supported Democratic President Lyndon Johnson’s Viet Nam war policies and was then the national party’s preferred candidate for the nomination.  Johnson had announced that he would not seek re-election in 1968, and Humphrey received the Democratic Party nomination for president in his place after Senator Kennedy’s assassination.  Richard Nixon soundly defeated Humphrey in the general election.    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kennedy’s declaration of independence from the DNC was driven in large part by the DNC’s determination to shield Biden from primary debates and potentially campaign-fatal losses in the early Iowa caucuses and the traditionally first-in-the nation New Hampshire presidential primary.  Biden received only 15.8 % of the in-person Iowa Democratic caucus vote in 2020 and merely 8.4 % of the vote in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary.  The DNC rescheduled the primaries to make South Carolina first (where Biden had defeated Senator Bernard Sanders in 2020).  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNC also gutted altogether the Iowa traditionally in-person caucuses and converted them into a mail-in ballot operation –ballots to be tallied in the middle of the primary season in order to avert likely Kennedy momentum after Iowa and New Hampshire victories.  The New Hampshire presidential primary had been first in the nation for over 100 years prior to Kennedy’s challenge to Biden.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNC also reserved a large block of unelected delegates loyal only to the DNC’s preferred candidate (Biden) –regardless of primary election outcomes. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Kennedy faced many of the same subterranean political maneuvers that the DNC deployed with ubiquitous media cooperation against Senator Sanders when Sanders challenged another DNC favored candidate in the 2016 presidential primaries: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The DNC never relented in its push to deny Sanders the Democratic nomination in 2016 despite the fact that the Vermont Senator consistently out-performed Clinton in public opinion polls against Donald Trump.    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNC also ignored Clinton’s losses to Sanders in Michigan and Wisconsin during the Democratic primaries and polls showing Sanders beating Donald Trump by very wide margins in Pennsylvania prior to that state’s presidential primary.  All three states were well-recognized as key battleground states in the general election.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanders won the Michigan primary with 49.8% of the Democratic vote and the Wisconsin primary with 56 % of the vote.  Propelled by DNC and major media support Clinton beat Sanders in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary, but Clinton lost Pennsylvania to Trump in the general election.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNC ignored these ominous signs of defeat and simply continued to press its Hilary Clinton hard sell strategy.   Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the DNC stuck with its favored candidate to the bitter end as “the candidate most likely to beat Mr. Trump.” Meanwhile, two days before the 2016 presidential election Gravis Marketing pitted Senator Sanders against Trump in a hypothetical contest.  The election eve poll results showed Sanders winning the election decisively with 56% of the vote.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now after undermining Robert Kennedy Jr’s challenge to Biden in the Democratic primaries and forcing Kennedy out of the party, which he and his family served for generations-- if the Zogby poll is accurate--the DNC might have pushed the candidate who presented its best chance to defeat President Trump out of the party.    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Kennedy announced that he would seek the presidency as an independent candidate, Fox Journalist, Sean Hannity, wanted to know how it was possible that the Democratic Party could be so hostile to the son of one of its most beloved leaders –a son as far as the <span>Times</span> on <span>its</span> analysis can tell-- who sees the nation very much through the same eyes as his fragile-tough father, and is now struggling to continue his father’s fight for liberty and peace.  On all accounts RFK Jr. certainly conducts a campaign well-within the value tradition of the classical Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Edward M. Kennedy, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cesar Chavez defined Democratic Party.   </p>
    <br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic2_0721.jpg" style="width: 90%;"/>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, Mr. Hannity’s query implicitly revealed <span>his</span> understanding that a history of the Kennedy family is nearly tantamount to a history of the Democratic Party at least after WWII.   And Hannity seemed bewildered that the contemporary DNC, instead of embracing a fair contest between Kennedy and Biden in a united effort to oppose the Republican nominee with its strongest candidate in the general election, it drove Kennedy from his father’s party, and the party of one of its most celebrated presidents and RFK Jr.'s devoted uncle, John F. Kennedy.    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the <span>Times</span> gathers data for analysis of the 2024 Presidential Campaign after Biden’s withdrawal from the race, it will also endeavor to evaluate at the same time one answer, which some observers offer to Mr. Hannity’s question:  the Neo-Democratic party is simply no longer the same party that its most illustrious leaders and statesmen built; it has fallen into the hands of dark money and operatives (some invisible) with insidious agendas.       </p>
