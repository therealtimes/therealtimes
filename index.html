    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUTLER, PA – A gunman fired shots at President Donald Trump and his supporters yesterday moments after the former president began to speak at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania --just two days before the Republican National Convention is scheduled to open.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bullet struck Trump in his right ear, failing to inflict a potentially mortal wound by less than an inch.  But one man attending the rally was struck in the head by a shot and died instantly.  Two others attending the rally were seriously injured.  The gunman fired several shots from the roof-top of a low rise building at the perimeter of the rally site.  Secret Service Agents at the scene shot and killed the assailant soon after he began firing.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the bullet struck President Trump, agents shouted “get down, get down” and then piled on top of him at the base of the speaker’s podium.  The gunman continued to fire shots at supporters.  After a special counter-assault Secret Service Agent shot and killed the gunman, Trump emerged from the pile and raised his fist defiantly.  The crowd cheered and began chanting USA, USA, USA. Then agents rushed Trump away from the rally site to seek medical attention.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the attack are slowly emerging.  The FBI has identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Hooks, a 20 year old man from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.  But Pennsylvania State Police have signaled that they intend a comprehensive investigation that will not assume a lone actor.  Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens told reporters “we are absolutely not taking for granted that this was a lone wolf attack, and so we would be looking at additional information that could point us to anyone else that may have had a hand in this." </p>

    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963 -- shortly after firing Alan Dulles as director of the CIA --as he was laying groundwork for his 1964 re-election campaign. Vice-president Lyndon Johnson immediately ascended to the presidency.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Robert F. Kennedy (the slain president’s brother) was assassinated on June 5, 1968 in Los Angeles while he was celebrating a victory in the 1968 California Democratic Presidential Primary  two months before the Democratic National Convention that year.  His murder put a sudden end to his impassioned effort to stop the Vietnam War.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic Party officials in 1968 greeted Senator Kennedy’s bid for the party’s nomination and his anti-war platform with aggressive opposition.  They planned to defeat Kennedy with unelected delegates loyal to the central party and Vice-President Hubert Humphrey.  But some political observers insist that Senator Kennedy would have eventually defeated Vice-President Humphrey (and Senator  Eugene McCarthy) for the Democratic Party nomination after his California primary victory and then gone on to defeat Richard Nixon –at that time the former vice-president under Dwight Eisenhower.</p>
    <br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic3.jpg"/>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once again an assassin changed the course of an American presidential election instead of the electorate.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. –nephew of the slain president and son of the slain Senator – is now challenging former president Donald Trump and Joseph Biden, the current Democrat incumbent, as an independent candidate for president.   </p>
    <br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic4.jpg"/>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy, like his father before him, is also waging an anti-war campaign.  He has accused Biden of blocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s efforts to achieve a peace agreement with Russian president Vladimir Putin known as the Minsk Accords resulting in the unnecessary deaths of thousands of young men and risk of world war.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to his announcement of an independent candidacy, Mr. Kennedy was challenging Joseph Biden for the Democratic Party nomination for president against vigorous-strategic opposition from the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  The DNC’s opposition to Robert Kennedy, Jr. during the primaries was reminiscent of the “behind closed doors” opposition that this father, Senator Kennedy, faced in 1968 when he opposed Vice-President Humphrey –then the national party’s preferred candidate for the nomination who supported President Johnson’s war policies.  Johnson had withdrawn from the 1968 presidential race, and Humphrey received the Democratic nomination for president after Senator Kennedy’s assassination.  Richard Nixon soundly defeated Humphrey in the general election.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kennedy’s declaration of independence from the DNC was driven in large part by the DNC’s refusal to schedule debates between Biden and Kennedy during the Democratic Presidential Primaries and the DNC’s threats not to count New Hampshire’s delegates if it insisted upon conducting its traditionally first-in-the-nation primary where Kennedy seemed poised to defeat Biden.  The DNC rescheduled the primaries to make South Carolina first (where Biden had defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in 2020) in order to avert likely Kennedy momentum after a New Hampshire victory.    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kennedy campaign has now released an exhaustive opinion poll that predicts that former president Donald Trump would defeat President Biden by a comfortable margin in a two-man contest.  The poll was conducted well-before the CNN Trump-Biden debate, which excluded Kennedy and has now led to calls from some Democrats for Biden to withdraw from the race.  The same poll further predicts that a two-man contest between Mr. Kennedy and the former president would be very close –Kennedy winning by a slender margin.  The poll also predicts that Kennedy would defeat Biden in a landslide in a hypothetical two-man general election contest between them.     </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mr. Kennedy’s presidential campaign gained traction he made five applications for Secret Service protection.  Kennedy has suffered two break-ins at his home.  And police arrested a gunman posing as a US Marshal at a Los Angeles Kennedy rally celebrating Hispanic heritage earlier this year.  Kennedy has emphasized in these applications that not only <span style="font-style: italic;">his</span> life is at risk but so are the lives of his supporters who attend his rallies.  During the Trump assassination attempt <span style="font-style: italic;">that gunman</span> killed one man attending the rally and seriously injured two others.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Biden, who described the attack on Trump as “sick, its sick,” has rejected each of Kennedy’s applications for protection.   Kennedy meanwhile saluted President Trump for his show of “courage.”   </p>
