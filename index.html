    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 900;font-style: normal;">GLENDALE, ARIZ -- </span> – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has united with President Donald Trump's effort to regain the White House.  Kennedy told a crowd of thousands of cheering voters at a Trump rally in Arizona yesterday that President Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine, stop government censorship, and end the American chronic disease epidemic.  President Trump also announced that “in Bobby’s honor” he would establish a special presidential commission on assassinations that would be tasked with releasing the remaining CIA documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy <span>and</span> a special commission on health to work with Kennedy to end the American health epidemic.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any observer familiar with the legendary rock band “The Who” and their hit album <span>Tommy</span> would say quite simply that “the crowd went crazy when <span>Kennedy</span> hit the stage.” The crowd cheered wildly and long when President Trump introduced Kennedy at the Arizona rally, and it raucously punctuated Kennedy’s address with applause and chants of “USA, USA and Bob-by, Bob-by.”  At least for these enthusiastic voters, Kennedy’s move marked the <span>real beginning</span> of his campaign against the Neo-Democratic Party–not the end.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Trump also saluted President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F.  Kennedy -- two of the former Democratic Party’s most formidable architects.  President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, and Senator Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles, California on June 5, 1968, on the night that he won the California Democratic Presidential Primary. President Trump’s introduction of Kennedy and Kennedy’s address at the rally are here.   </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the son of Senator Kennedy and the nephew of President Kennedy.  But purged by <span>Neo-Democrats</span> from the party that his father and uncle lost their lives building, Mr. Kennedy  issued a somber warning last week that “the Democratic Party has become the greatest threat to democracy in the country.” Kennedy declared that <span>Neo-Democrat</span> “elites don’t believe in democracy or trust the voters anymore.  They think that <span>they</span> are entitled to choose who you are <span>allowed</span> to vote for.  They think that <span>they</span> should be the judges of what is best for you and your family.”  Kennedy also warned in a separate statement on August 15 that <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span> officials no longer embrace his father’s or President Kennedy’s values.  Kennedy’s entire August 15 statement is <a href="https://x.com/robertkennedyjr/status/1824053188799889650?s=51" targe="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kennedy’s warning of the demise of the former Democratic Party, the rise of an authoritarian <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span>, and his union with President Trump --the Republican nominee for president – has to be understood as a volcanic moment in the history of America.  Kennedy told reporters yesterday that he attended his first Democratic Convention when he was six years old. </p>
    <br><br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic2_0824.jpg" style="width: 50%;"/>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">“Back then, he said, “the Democrats were the champions of the Constitution, and civil rights. The Democrats stood against authoritarianism, against censorship, and against colonialism, imperialism, and unjust wars.”  But after a lifetime of devotion to the Democratic Party and intimate involvement in it since early childhood, Kennedy left the party last October because “it had become the party of war, censorship, corruption.”  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to announcing his <span>independent</span> candidacy, Mr. Kennedy was challenging Joseph Biden for the Democratic Party nomination for president against intense opposition from the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  Mr. Kennedy’s declaration of independence from the DNC was driven in large part by the DNC’s determination to shield Biden from primary debates and potentially campaign-fatal losses in the early Iowa caucuses and the traditionally first-in-the nation New Hampshire presidential primary.  Biden received only 15.8 % of the in-person Iowa Democratic caucus vote in 2020 and merely 8.4 % of the vote in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary.  The DNC rescheduled the primaries to make South Carolina first (where Biden had defeated Senator Bernard Sanders in 2020).   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNC also gutted altogether the Iowa traditionally in-person caucuses and converted them into a mail-in ballot operation –ballots to be tallied in the middle of the primary season in order to avert likely Kennedy momentum after Iowa and New Hampshire victories.  The New Hampshire presidential primary had been first in the nation for over 100 years prior to Kennedy’s challenge to Biden.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNC also reserved a large block of <span>unelected</span> delegates loyal only to the DNC’s preferred candidate (Biden) –- <span>regardless</span> of primary election outcomes. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Kennedy faced many of the same subterranean political maneuvers that the DNC deployed with ubiquitous media cooperation against Senator Sanders when Sanders challenged another DNC favored candidate in the 2016 presidential primaries: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The DNC never relented in its push to deny Sanders the Democratic nomination in 2016 despite the fact that the Vermont Senator consistently out-performed Clinton in public opinion polls against Donald Trump.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy insisted yesterday in an address to the nation before appearing at President Trump’s rally that ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CNN finally “exposed themselves” during his 2024 primary challenge to Biden “as Democratic Party organs.” Kennedy asked representatives of these networks to consider that they abdicated their duty to “safeguard democracy and challenge the party in power” instead of making themselves “government mouthpieces and stenographers for the organs of power.” Kennedy told them “you did not alone cause the devolution of America’s democracy, but you could have prevented it.”  Kennedy’s entire address is <a href="https://robertfkennedyjr.substack.com/p/why-i-am-suspending-my-campaign-for?publication_id=611154&post_id=148055618&trigger=" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Kennedy announced that he would seek the presidency as an independent candidate, Fox Journalist, Sean Hannity, wanted to know how it was possible that the DNC could be so hostile to the son of one of its most celebrated leaders.  On all accounts RFK Jr.’s presidential campaign was certainly well-within the value tradition of the classical Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Edward M. Kennedy, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cesar Chavez defined Democratic Party. </p>
    <br><br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic3_0824.jpg" style="width: 80%;"/>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">And to be sure, Mr. Hannity’s query implicitly revealed his understanding, too, that a history of the Kennedy family is nearly tantamount to a history of the Democratic Party at least after WWII.   Hannity accordingly was bewildered that the contemporary DNC, instead of embracing a fair contest between Kennedy and Biden (letting voters decide between them) would instead purge Kennedy from his father’s party and the party of one of its most formidable presidents, John F. Kennedy --RFK Jr.’s beloved uncle.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy finally gave his most explicit answer to Hannity’s question just last week in his August 15th warnings to the nation. He declared that the <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span> is simply no longer the <span>same</span> party that his father and President Kennedy helped to build.  Kennedy insisted that the “‘V.P. Harris Democratic Party’ would be <span>unrecognizable</span> to my father and uncle.” And he emphasized further that “the <span>Democratic Party</span> of RFK and JFK was the party of civil liberties and free speech.” But the <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span> (which he described as Harris’s party) “is the party of censorship, lockdowns, and medical coercion.  “Kennedy Democrats were anti-war,” but the <span>Neo-Democrats</span>, he added, are “riddled with ‘neocon’ (neo-conservative) warmongers."</p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy now joins Elon Musk in aligning with President Trump in an effort to stop the rise of the Neo-Democratic Party.  Musk announced on May 18, 2022 that he could “no longer support the Democratic Party.” He wrote that "in the past I voted Democrat because they were mostly the kindness party.  But they have become the party of division and hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.”  </p>
    <br>
    <img class='pic' src="./assets/images/pic4_0824.jpg" style="width: 80%;"/>
    <br><br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Trump, Elon Musk, and Robert Kennedy Jr. are perhaps the three most powerful men in America today to insist that the <span>Neo-Democratic Party</span> is now an authoritarian party that achieves its objectives through media control and censorship, which Kennedy declared is “the first step onto the slippery slope to totalitarianism.”  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="reportText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously, Marina Oswald was perhaps the first to realize that America underwent an enormous transformation when President Kennedy was assassinated. Failure to expose those responsible for the death of President Kennedy, she said in 1988, "will destroy this nation."  </p>
